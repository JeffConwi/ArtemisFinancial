# ArtemisFinancial
Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that specializes in developing individualized financial plans for its clients, covering areas such as savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company sought to modernize its operations by enhancing the security of its RESTful web application programming interface (API), which is integral to providing these services securely and efficiently.

Software Requirements:
The main issue Artemis Financial faced was the need to bolster the security of their web-based software application to protect against external threats. This requirement was critical given the sensitive nature of the financial data handled by their systems.

Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities
Achievements:
I successfully identified and addressed several security vulnerabilities within Artemis Financial’s software. By conducting a thorough vulnerability assessment, I managed to pinpoint areas where the software was susceptible to security breaches such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and inadequate data encryption.

Importance of Secure Coding:
Secure coding is vital as it protects applications from malicious attacks that could compromise data integrity and confidentiality. For a financial firm like Artemis Financial, robust software security ensures that client data is protected, which in turn maintains client trust and upholds the company’s reputation.

Value of Software Security:
Software security adds immense value to a company’s well-being by safeguarding its data assets, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations, and preventing potential financial losses due to security breaches.

Challenges and Helpful Aspects of the Vulnerability Assessment
Challenges:
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring comprehensive coverage of all potential security threats, especially those that are less obvious or emerge from complex interactions within the application.

Helpful Aspects:
The process of manual code review was particularly helpful as it allowed for a detailed examination of the code, which facilitated a deeper understanding of the application’s functionality and potential security weaknesses.

Increasing Layers of Security
Future Assessments and Mitigation Techniques:
In the future, I plan to use advanced static and dynamic analysis tools to assess vulnerabilities more comprehensively. Implementing automated security scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline will ensure continuous assessment and mitigation of potential security issues.

Ensuring Functional and Secure Software
Verification of Security Post-Refactoring:
After refactoring the code to address identified vulnerabilities, I re-ran the entire suite of unit and integration tests to ensure that no new issues were introduced. Additionally, I used regression testing to verify that the existing functionalities remained unaffected by the changes.

Tools and Practices for Future Tasks:
I employed several resources and best practices that proved invaluable, such as:

OWASP ZAP: For finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
SonarQube: For continuous inspection of code quality to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
Secure Coding Guidelines: Following best practices from OWASP and other standards to write more secure code.
